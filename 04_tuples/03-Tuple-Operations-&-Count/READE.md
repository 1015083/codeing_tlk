# Challenge 3 - Tuple Operations & Count

## Problem Description:
This program asks the user for a fruit name and then counts how many times that fruit appears in a predefined tuple.

## Pseudo Code:
1. Create a tuple with repeated values.
2. Ask the user for a fruit name.
3. Use the count() method to find how many times the fruit appears.
4. Print the result.

## Intent:
The goal is to practice using the `count()` method to find occurrences of an item in a tuple.
1. Create a tuple with repeated values, such as `("apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "apple")`.  
2. Ask the user to enter a fruit name.  
3. Print how many times that fruit appears in the tuple.  

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter a fruit name: apple
'apple' appears 3 times in the tuple.
```

(Hint: Use the `count()` method like `tuple_name.count(value)`.)
