# Challenge 2 - Swapping Values Using Tuples

## Problem Description:
This program demonstrates how to swap two values without using a temporary variable, by using tuple unpacking.

## Pseudo Code:
1. Get two numbers from the user.
2. Store them in a tuple.
3. Swap the two values using tuple unpacking.
4. Print the swapped values.

## Intent:
The goal is to practice using tuple unpacking to swap variables efficiently.
