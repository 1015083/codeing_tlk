## Pseudo Code:
1. Create a tuple containing five different types of elements.
2. Print the entire tuple.
3. Access the third element and print it.
4. Extract the nested tuple and print its first element.

## Intent:
The goal is to practice basic tuple operations such as access, unpacking, and handling nested tuples.
