Write a function called say_hello that takes no arguments and prints "Hello, world!" 
def:
This is a keyword in Python used to define a function.

say_hello:
This is the name of the function. You can name it anything (as long as it follows Python’s naming rules), but say_hello is descriptive—it tells us what the function does.

():
These parentheses indicate that the function takes no parameters. That means it doesn't require any input when called.

The colon marks the beginning of the function body—everything indented under this line is part of the function.

print("Hello, world!")
This line is the body of the function. It executes when the function is called and simply prints the text "Hello, world!" to the screen.
