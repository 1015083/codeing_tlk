ðŸ“Œ Pseudocode
1. Start the program.
2. Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
3. Initialize user_guess as None.
4. Repeat until the user guesses correctly:
â€¢ Ask the user to enter a guess.
â€¢ If the guess is not a number, print an error and ask again.
â€¢ If the guess is out of range (less than 1 or greater than 10), prompt the user
again.
â€¢ If the guess is too low, print "Too low, try again!"
â€¢ If the guess is too high, print "Too high, try again!"
â€¢ If the guess is correct, print "Correct! ðŸŽ‰" and stop the loop.
